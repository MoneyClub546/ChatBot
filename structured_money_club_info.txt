                                    Clubbers will need to pay a penalty in case

                                    A Club will be declared defaulted if any of
                                    the following conditions are met:
                                    



                                        One or more members of a club refuse or
                                        fail to make the necessary transfers
                                        against a round of bidding before the

                                    If someone defaults in a club, he/she gets
                                    blacklisted from the Money Club platform.
                                    Therefore, if someone defaults in 1 club,
                                    he/she is considered as a defaulter in all
                                    his/her active clubs.

                                    app) in any of his/her clubs + 1 day, he/she
                                    is declared as a defaulter in all his/her
                                    active clubs on the Money Club platform.
                                  



                                    Due amount: In case of a default, the due
                                    amount is the sum total of all the present
                                    and future commitments in all the money
                                    clubs wherein someone has defaulted. And it
                                    will also include the penalty amount for
                                    delayed transfers, whenever applicable.
                                  



                                    If a net investor (someone who has not won
                                    the club amount in his/her money club/s)
                                    fails to complete his transaction in his/her
                                    money club/s before the next scheduled bid
                                    date + 1 day and the club defaults, he will
                                    be replaced with another member to continue
                                    the club. The investor can get the invested
                                    amount refunded (after deducting
                                    penalty/commission if any) by writing to the
                                    Money Club support team through the Help

                                    In case of pilot clubs, if any member fails
                                    to make the payment within 18 hours from the
                                    bid start time, he would be considered to

Investor default:
 If

                                        winning the pooled amount, he/she will

                                    Once the bidding is complete, the app will
                                    compute and show the amount that each member
                                    has to pay to the winner.
                                  




Golden Rule:
 All the club
                                    members should complete their transaction
                                    and update it on the app within an hour from
                                    the end time of bidding. Members following
                                    this rule build a reputed transaction
                                    history on the platform and gain more
                                    benefits.
                                  



                                    The winner has to transfer commission to the
                                    Money Club bank account as calculated by the
                                    app
                                  



                                    Other members will have to transfer their
                                    contribution amount â (bid amount/(club
                                    size-1)) to the bid winner.
                                  



                                    The app requires each member to update the
                                    transaction ID (UTR number or reference
                                    number) of the transaction on the Money Club
                                    app so that the winner can check and confirm
                                    the receipt of funds.
                                  



                                    The Club can be moved to the next round only
                                    after all fund transfers are
                                    updated/confirmed by the club members.
                                  



                                    All members of the club will receive
                                    courtesy reminders about the pending
                                    transactions both through the app
                                    notification, SMS and email, however members
                                    should ensure to transfer the amount right
                                    after the bidding is complete.
                                  



                                    If any member does not complete his/her
                                    transaction for the current round in any of
                                    his clubs before the scheduled day of
                                    bidding for the next round, we give
                                    additional time to that member and he/she
                                    can complete his/her transaction before 6 PM
                                    the next day and avoid defaulting on the
                                    platform.

The Frequently asked questions


 Q. What happens if someone defaults?


Ans. 
 The Money Club replaces the defaulter with one of the Money Club team members to continue the club. In the background, we follow our debt recovery protocol to recover the funds from the defaulter. Repercussions of default are given in 
this blog.


 Q. What if no one bids for the money?


 
Ans. 
If no one bids in the first one minute of the live bidding countdown, the Money club app would run an algorithm to identify a member randomly. It will then bid the minimum bid amount (1% of the pool amount) on his/her behalf to start the bid. Bidding can then proceed normally post that. We call this feature AUTO BID.


 Q. How to transfer the money after a bid ends?


Ans. 
Users only need to make a commitment when they join a club on the app. This doesnât require them to transfer funds at that time. After the bidding, a winner is declared based on the highest bid amount. The club members get a popup in the Money Club mobile app, showing the details of the winner (UPI ID, bank account details, amount to be paid to the winner, etc.). Members can directly transfer the funds from their bank account to the winnerâs bank account. They also need to update the transaction ID in the Money Club app immediately after making the payment.


 Q. What is the amount charged by Money Club?


Ans. 
Commission




This new commission structure is applicable for the clubs formed under the terms and conditions version 8 and above.




The commission of every user will be calculated based on the tables below and it is the percentage of the 
total pooled club amount
. (For example â If a userâs current commission is 2% and he participates in a club of 10,000 INR pooled amount, then he would pay 200 INR as commission to The Money Club when he wins the round.)






The commission for the Pilot club is fixed at 
15 INR. 
Applicable for the pilot clubs formed under the terms and conditions version 9 and above.




The commission will be taken as the average of the three factors â 
Real closed clubs, contribution amount & weighted average transfer time.




The commission(%) will keep on changing and it ranges from [4.0 â 0.5] % depending on these three factors.

For example
 â If a user has closed 
4
 real clubs whose total contribution amount is 
22000 INR
 & weighted average transfer time is 
1.5 hours
, then his commission would be â


Commission(%) = (2.5+3.5+1)/3 = 
2.33 %
 (Refer above tables to understand the calculations)


Contribution amount = Contribution amount paid by user in every round + Money Club credits used by user 
+ Winning bid amount by user in club + Penalty paid by user to Money club + Commission paid by user to Money club


 
Weighted average transfer time




 Your recent transactions have more weightage than the earlier transactions. So if you want to improve your weighted average transfer time, then try to complete your upcoming transactions at the earliest and your weighted average transfer time will improve faster.


 For example, suppose there are total 5 transactions. The 1st transactionâs weight is taken as 1 and itâs multiplied by the transfer time. The 2nd transactionâs weight is taken as 2 & so on and it will be divided by n(n+1)/2 where n is the number of your transactions.


 1st transaction transfer time  = 12 Hours
2nd transaction transfer time = 10 Hours
3rd transaction transfer time = 4 Hours
4th transaction transfer time = 2 Hours
5th transaction transfer time = 1 Hour


 Weighted average transfer time = 12*1 + 10*2 + 4*3 + 2*4 + 5*1 / 5(5+1)/2 = 
3.8 Hrs




 Q. Where and how does the bidding takes place?


 
Ans. 
Bidding takes place in the Money Club app. All the club members can join live bidding by logging in to the Money Club app. Bidding window also allows the club members to chat.

SOSV, a global VC fund and Venture Catalysts, invest in The Money Club, a fintech startup that has built an AI-based P2P Group Savings Platform to enable the lower-middle-class population to save, borrow and invest digitally. The Pre-Series A round saw participation from other investors including Blume Founders’ Fund, LetsVenture, Keiretsu Forum, Rockstud Capital, Astarc Ventures, and LIV Advisors.

Founded by IIT Kharagpur friends, Manuraj Jain and Surajit Ray, The Money Club leverages AI algorithms to effectively underwrite high frequency, micro pooling of funds by studying user behaviours. Acting as an artificially intelligent chit fund cashier in the form of an android app, the startup delivers a higher value proposition to savers, investors, as well as borrowers compared to all other available options in the market. With the fresh infusion of capital, The Money Club aims to disrupt India’s largely unorganized $50bn chit fund sector and bring greater security and transparency.


Speaking on the fund raise, Manuraj Jain, Founder and CEO of The Money Club, said, ‘’Users have been pooling money for over 700 years and this market has been growing 15% CAGR for the last 10 years. High onboarding barriers and lack of innovation in Savings products, has driven 180m in India to resort to pooling funds illegally in the form of committees, beesi, chitty and chit funds and expose themselves to fraud and loss of their hard earned money.


Our vision is to make a Savings product that is relevant, lucrative, safe, secure and transparent for over 40Cr low middle income people of India. We want to build the world’s largest AI embedded Money pooling platform from Bharat. An overwhelming response from our users and getting oversubscribed in this round by our investors provide us with the fillip to grow faster."

William Bao Bean, General Partner at SOSV, shares,  "Money Club has been a pioneer in fostering economic empowerment through its solution, bringing trust and transparency to financial transactions for millions of people in India. We're impressed with the team's relentless focus in tackling this multi-billion opportunity: Money Club's AI-enabled underwriting model is a game-changer that will streamline capital flows for the whole nation".


“Peer to Peer lending and Money Pooling clubs have been a part of society for generations now albeit in a unorganised format that’s prone to cheating and vulnerable to being influenced by certain powerful members. What we loved is that 'The Money Club' enables this phenomena with a secure and seamless digital platform thereby providing numerous people with an instrument to save and borrow funds when they need to, without any hassle! We believe Bharat is ready for this age-old practice to be available at their fingertips,” said Sarita Raichura, Blume Founders’ Fund.


“We are very excited to be backing the Money Club team. They are bringing an age-old system of how people help each other with money for their needs into the digital age, with a model which works very well. We are truly excited to be a part of money clubs journey ahead and play our part in helping them achieve their vision,” said Salil Musale, Managing Director, Astarc Ventures.

“Chit funds are one of the oldest forms of borrowing platforms for people who were excluded from the formal financial system. However, they are highly unorganized and are ripe for technological disruption. Money Club is at the forefront driving this change with the use of technology and making its services more transparent and reliable compared to traditional chit fund companies.” said Abhishek Agarwal, Managing Partner at Rockstud Capital.
